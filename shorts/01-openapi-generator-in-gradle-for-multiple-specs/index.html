This is expected when doing a full rebuild (a <code>gradle clean build</code> locally or in a CI pipeline), but why would you want that when you are just running your unit tests? This actually makes the process of writing unit tests not very pleasant.<blockquote><p><em>I still don’t know if that projects’ lack of tests was the result of this, or just nobody bothered to fix this issue due to the lack of tests</em> 🤔</blockquote><h1 id=the-cause>The Cause</h1><p>In the existing configuration of the project, each generator task used the same folder as a target – <code>build/generated/openapi</code>. This worked fine for the API code since each spec was built to a different package and didn’t mix. However, besides the code, the plugin also generates a set of project files (like maven pom.xml, etc.).<br> The code didn’t mix due to different packages, but those files did, and each next task was overwriting project files from the previous.<br> Because of that, for every build Gradle considered that the generated code (those project files specifically) did not match what was generated before, and it’s right about time to go generate everything again.<h2 id=example>Example</h2><p>Let’s make a minimal reproduction of the issue first. Here’s the recipe.<ol><li>Take two OpenAPI specs to your liking to generate Server API interfaces.</ol><p><strong>Spec A:</strong><pre class="language-yaml z-code" data-lang=yaml data-name=book-catalog-api.yaml><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml data-name=book-catalog-api.yaml><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">openapi</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span> <span class="z-constant z-numeric z-float z-decimal z-yaml">3<span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-decimal z-yaml">.</span>0.3</span>

</span></code></pre><p>Let’s try to fix that.<h1 id=the-crutch-crutch>The Crutch 🩼</h1><p>A logical solution that comes to mind is to disable generation of those project files. Unfortunately, all I could find are issues like this one – <a href=https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/20538 rel=noopener target=_blank>[REQ] Option to generate only the models/controllers</a><p>Instead, we will do two things:<ol><li>exclude as much project files as possible from generation, and<li>extract each API into its own folder.</ol><p>Technically, you could only do the second, and it would solve the issue, but I wanted to keep the sources as clean as possible.<h2 id=cleanup-broom>Cleanup 🧹</h2><p>The only working way to remove unnecessary project files happens to be through <code>.openapi-generator-ignore</code>. Put a file like this into the root (or wherever you like):<pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain">*
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">**/*
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">!**src/main/java/**/*
</span></code></pre><p>This file excludes from generation all files that are not in the source directory. Exactly what we needed.<p>But there is one issue still, which requires the second step. There are two metadata files added in <code>.openapi-generator</code> folder: <code>FILES</code> and <code>VERSION</code>. They contain a list of all generated files, and version of the generator accordingly. And they are not excluded by the ignore file :(</p><img src=/img/shorts/openapi/meta-files.png><p>So now when several tasks generate sources – each will overwrite those files from the previous.<p>Let’s continue.<h2 id=extraction>Extraction 🪏</h2><p>The only option we have left is to put every API interface into its own folder.<br> We will change the task configuration a bit, and will write some more config to attach the sources to the <code>sourceSets</code>.<br> Significant changes are highlighted.<pre class="language-gradle z-code" data-lang=gradle><code class=language-gradle data-lang=gradle><span class="z-source z-groovy"><span class="z-comment z-line z-double-slash z-groovy"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-groovy">//</span> Generate server stubs for book catalog API
